Loan Project

Overview
This project aims to analyze and preprocess credit data for machine learning applications. The process includes data cleaning, filtering, and dividing the dataset into training and test sets. The primary objective is to generate a well-structured subset of credit data suitable for further exploration and modeling. The implementation leverages libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn.

Collaboration: This project is conducted in cooperation with user https://github.com/SSJ0406, who has focused on analyzing patterns in credit risk, identifying key factors influencing loan approvals, and evaluating the impact of different preprocessing techniques on model performance.
